# FOUR-IN-A-ROW

If you hate how small the 7x7 board is for four in a row because there isn't enough spaces to make enough moves to win then try this LARGE SCALE FOUR IN A ROW OUT! This is a 21x21 four-in a row Game. You will know have the space of 9 7x7 boards in order to beat your friends! 

###### Instructions to run on IntelliJ IdEA ######

Create a new Java project. You will not need to select any special libraries/features or to use any template.
Add the .java source files to the project. This is most directly done via a graphical interface by selecting and dragging (or copying, if you prefer) the files to the src directory (folder) in the IntelliJ project view.
Edit the Configurations (can be selected from the Run menu). Click + to add a new configuration. Select Application, enter Basic (for instance) as the name, and enter VirtualWorld as the main class. (You might add additional configurations with -fast, -faster, or -fastest as the respective program argument later.)
Open the Project Structure (under File), choose Modules (on the left), and select the Dependencies tab (middle top of the page). Click the + to add a new JAR. In the file selection dialog, find and select the processing-core.jar that you should have downloaded from GitHub.

You should now be able to build and execute the program. Executing the program, however, will not load the proper resources for the graphical interface.

To run the program properly, copy the gaia.sav file, the imagelist, and the images directory to the project folder in the project view.


Good luck and feel free to message me if there are any bugs or problems you are having when running this program. :D
